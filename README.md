# Unhandled Exceptions in Asynchronous Dart

This example demonstrates a common error in Dart: inadequate error handling in asynchronous operations. The `fetchData` function attempts to fetch data from a remote API. However, it doesn't properly handle potential exceptions during the network request or JSON decoding.

## The Problem

The original code lacks robust error handling.  If the API request fails (e.g., network error, server error), or if the JSON response is malformed, the exception may be silently swallowed, leading to unexpected behavior or application crashes. 

## The Solution

The improved version includes comprehensive `try-catch` blocks to handle potential exceptions at each step and provides informative error messages.
